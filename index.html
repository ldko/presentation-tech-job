Dear Hiring Manager,

I am a recent computer science graduate with
coursework in algorithms, Java, and C++. Based
on my qualifications, I am a perfect fit for
your job.

Please contact me at 555-555-5555 to set up an
interview.

Sincerely,
Someone who doesn't care that much

Dear Ms. Hirey,

I found your Digital Libraries Programmer
position listed on the UNT HR website. I am
excited to apply because I would like to be
part of an organization like yours that makes
resources available to a global community
with projects like the UNT Digital
Collections.

I already possess several skills your job
posting lists as desired. I recently
graduated with a degree in computer science
where I specialized in building web
applications. This has given me experience
working in a Linux environment deploying PHP
applications in Apache with a MySQL database
backend. While I do not have much experience
working in Python, I have recently begun
learning the language and am using it to
build a small web application to catalog my
personal music collection. The code is
at http://github.com/imajobseeker189x/py-music-catalog.

I currently work as a customer service
representative where I have gained
experience working as part of a team and
serving customers' needs. Such work has
trained me to collaborate with others and to
be considerate of user needs. I believe that
this experience combined with my technical
background, make me a strong candidate to
serve your library's user community.

I am available to discuss the position at
anytime that is convenient for you at
555-555-5555. Thank you for your time and
consideration.

Sincerely,
Ima Jobseeker
                                                </small></pre>
